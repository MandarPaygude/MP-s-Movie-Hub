Hello there! I feel proud to publish my first live project using Heroku Cloud Platform for deploying my new Machine Learning Project (Name: MPâ€™s Movie Hub). Precisely, this project is a Movie Recommendation System; but adding on to it I have added sentiment analysis feature to make it more interesting.

1) For making the same I have transformed the data into pickle files which are byte files readable to any working software (I was working on @Pycharm). I have converted the data into a matrix form to access and operate it easily. Used vectorizer.transform(), predict() functionalities for analysing the sentiments of the viewers based on their shared feedback keywords.

2) For deploying it as an application, I have issued an authorised API key to make it interactive UI.

3) I have done this by taking data of around 37k+ movies and their details from different platforms (@imdb, @rotten tomatoes, @tmdb etc.) 

4) Used and understood core knowledge and practical application of python libraries and frameworks including flask, pickleshare, scikit-learn,  jinja, tmdbv3api, lxml, scipy, numpy, gunicorn.

Let me know if you liked the webpage and share your feedback to improve the features.
Eager to try such more interesting things, explore and dive into the ML/DL domains.
Happy Learning ðŸ˜Š
