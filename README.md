# MP-s-Movie-Hub
Hello there! I feel proud to publish my first live project using Heroku Cloud Platform for deploying my new Machine Learning Project (Name: MPâ€™s Movie Hub). Precisely, this project is a Movie Recommendation System; but adding on to it I have added sentiment analysis feature to make it more interesting.

ïƒ˜	For making the same I have transformed the data into pickle files which are byte files readable to any working software (I was working on @Pycharm). I have converted the data into a matrix form to access and operate it easily. Used vectorizer.transform(), predict() functionalities for analysing the sentiments of the viewers based on their shared feedback keywords.
ïƒ˜	For deploying it as an application, I have issued an authorised API key to make it interactive UI.
ïƒ˜	I have done this by taking data of around 37k+ movies and their details from different platforms (@imdb, @rotten tomatoes, @tmdb etc.) 
ïƒ˜	Used and understood core knowledge and practical application of python libraries and frameworks including flask, pickleshare, scikit-learn,  jinja, tmdbv3api, lxml, scipy, numpy, gunicorn.

Let me know if you liked the webpage and share your feedback to improve the features.
Eager to try such more interesting things, explore and dive into the ML/DL domains.
Happy Learning ðŸ˜Š
